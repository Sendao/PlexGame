Leftover:
 Console:
  - allow multiline entry and save/use/delete queries

Monitor:
 - use messages to logfile/shell as indication that process is running even if psgrep doesn't find it
 - don't kill so quickly new processes anyway
 - allow more retries before giving up
 - sometimes it gets stuck unable to start processes
 - should have better visibility for actual crashes
  - track all crashes to one file as well as the multiple dated crash-specific files



Other:

Local socket


Web socket
  - periodically clean up connections and registrations
